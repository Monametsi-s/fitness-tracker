Great to hear that the app is working fine now! You can now:

1. Track your workouts with:
   - Exercise type
   - Duration
   - Intensity level (low, medium, high)
   - Automatic calorie calculations

2. Use the quick start presets for common workouts

3. View your workout history and track your progress over time

4. Delete any workout entries you want to remove

The app will use the Gemini API for calorie calculations, with a fallback calculation method if needed. Is there anything specific you'd like to add or modify in the app?
